## 개요
<strong>헬레니스모스(Ἑλληνισμός)</strong>는 그리스와 세계 각지에서 실천 중인, 그리스 신화를 배경으로 한 현대 다신론적 종교를 말한다.

## 상세
Hellenismos (Ἑλλήνισμος), also known as 'Dodekatheism', 'Hellenism', and 'Hellenic Polytheism' or 'Hellenic Reconstructionism,' is the modern practice of the ancient Hellenic (Greek) religion. It focusses on the worship of the Twelve Olympic Gods—Zeus, Hera, Athena, Hēphaistos, Apollon, Artemis, Demeter, Hestia, Hermes, Ares, Poseidon and Aphrodite—along with the entire pantheon of Hellenic Gods, known collectively as the Theoi. Most Hellenists honour other types of divinities, including nature spirits, Khthonic (or Underworld) Deities, and heroes. Both physical and spiritual ancestors are honoured. Hellenists tend to be hard polytheists, meaning they view all Gods as separate entities and not linked through portfolio.
